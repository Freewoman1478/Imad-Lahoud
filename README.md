Who is Imad Lahoud
The World Expo has been held every 5 years since 2000. For the 2020 edition, the international exhibition bureau voted Dubai. However, the health crisis has caused its postponement by one year.

Nearly 190 countries participate in this event which started on October 1st and will be held until March 31st. Each exhibitor has six months to showcase its technological advances and special know-how.

According to Imad Lahoud, a Franco-Lebanese who has been living in the Emirates for nearly 10 years, Expo Dubai is more than just a tourist attraction. Here are the innovative products that deserve attention according to him.

Imad Lahoud: "The Dutch stand out with an autonomous biotope

The first visitors were able to discover the concept imagined by the firm V8 architects. The idea was awarded the prize for the sustainable construction project 2021. The biotope is equipped with a climate system. It produces water as well as food. The miniature world can also provide for its own energy needs.

For this purpose, the design studio Marjan van Aubel designed the solar covers for the site. These are patterned canopies that are intended to restore light. The technique is known as "skylights". The project aims to meet current environmental requirements - too many buildings still have a significant environmental footprint despite the many energy conventions in place.

After the exhibition, the ecological materials will be dismantled and reused.

Imad Lahoud Presents : The rainforest in the spotlight

In the Singapore pavilion, the rainforest is in the spotlight. The WOHA company has reconstructed a forest environment using 3D technology. In concrete terms, it will propose a virtual walk through the green decorations and a hilly landscape. A walk in the canopy remains the experience to try. It is perched 9 meters high.

The stand - with zero energy - reserves an immersive three-dimensional experience with sounds and images. For your information, the event addresses three themes: sustainability, mobility and opportunity. The site is powered by an autonomous ecosystem. Apart from the walk, you will discover the history of Singapore through various interactive attractions. There are even plans to tantalize the taste buds with the flavors of some of the dishes.

Imad Lahoud: "Germany's playful pedagogy of green!"

The German campus will allow visitors to learn about the innovative and sustainable solutions of the coming years. This time, visitors can take on the role of a student by entering the German showroom. They will work in study rooms. These are equipped with a swing seat. The areas of the stand are divided by theme. Visitors will see energy and futuristic laboratories. The Germans have also thought of projects related to biodiversity. The explorations will be done with the help of connected devices. The goal of such an initiative is to teach children and adults about the world with fun activities. The centerpiece of the pavilion is the atrium.

Imad Lahoud: "Fiberglass clouds for the Prague spring!"

The Czech Republic has put together an impressive installation. Have you ever heard of clouds made of... fiberglass? The project - signed Formosa AA - is focused on agriculture in desert terrains. For this, water vapor from the air is extracted in a photobioreactor to composted tea. The goal is to make arid soils fertile by using the algae produced. This energy performance exploits only solar energy.

Initially, the scientists thought to apply the method to help the United Arab Emirates in their agricultural challenges. Two products were targeted, namely olive trees and palm trees. The stand also offers a business meeting room. Several company representatives are expected to attend each day. An opportunity to take a break or to network...

The Argentinean pavilion: business and gastronomy

The Argentinian stand is focused on the theme of opportunity in order to attract international investors. Visitors will be able to learn more about the country's history through three-dimensional images. All the senses will be stimulated during this stop. You can taste many local products. Moreover, the products offered can be purchased at attractive prices. There are other activities to mention among the conferences. You will meet many professionals who could possibly be partners in the field of import-export ...

Imad Lahoud: "The Emirates are betting on the aircraft of the future

The Emirates pavilion will be part of the must-see. The UAE reveals a little-known expertise in the aeronautics sector. However, it is likely that the country's innovations could significantly influence the future of aircraft in a few years. Thanks to new construction techniques, passenger comfort will be significantly improved.

The use of light metal materials is the key to this Pulse Group invention. For example, manufacturers are using composites instead of conventional metals. This change will result in fuel savings and greater strength in the air. The propulsion systems are also of a new generation. The host country's booth will also teach visitors about aerodynamics.

Smart travel

The Chinese pavilion is for all visitors who would like to see China's "Leap Forward" in the space race. They will be able to see space exploration as well as 5G advances. The country is also relying on artificial intelligence to drive autonomous cars. Travelers from around the world will be welcomed in one of the largest booths at the World Expo: 4,636 square meters! The architecture of the pavilion is a proof of the success of the Western and Chinese collaboration.

The shape of the pavilion is reminiscent of a lantern. The building was designed to revisit Chinese culture during its 5000 years of history. The world conclave also has the interest to open new perspectives to China in terms of international trade. An unmissable opportunity to understand the world and its possibilities...
